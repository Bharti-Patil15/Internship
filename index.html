    <h2>About Me</h2><br><br>
    
  <p>
    Hello! I'm <strong>Ram</strong>, <p>
      I’m a passionate programmer and problem-solver with a strong foundation in 
      <strong>data structures, algorithms, and software development</strong>.  
      I enjoy building efficient solutions, whether it’s developing full-stack applications, 
      optimizing systems, or experimenting with machine learning models.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I’ve worked on projects ranging from 
      <strong>real-time stock prediction models</strong> to 
      <strong>city-scale optimization dashboards</strong>, which helped me gain hands-on experience 
      in both <strong>AI-driven solutions</strong> and practical software engineering.  
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to continuously learn, contribute to impactful projects, 
      and grow as a developer who bridges innovation with real-world applications.  
      Currently, I’m open to <strong>internships, collaborations, and freelance opportunities</strong>.
